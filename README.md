If you want to use a cloud based solution such as [mLabs](https://mlab.com) that is fine, you just need to replace the `connection string` with the one provided.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushnanda21/fictional-rotary <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> && cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```
